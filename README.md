A Clarity With Data micro-project exploring how names shape perception using SSA baby name data and cultural pattern analysis.


Data source: U.S. Social Security Administration baby name data (1980–present).
Method: Names are clustered using KMeans on normalized year-by-year frequency patterns to create 4 “Name Signatures.” Clusters are interpreted using the most common names in each group (e.g., traditional White/European names, historically Black-associated names, Hispanic/Latino-influenced names, and modern cross-cultural names).
Important: These signatures describe population-level naming patterns, not the identity of any individual person.
